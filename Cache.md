# Cache
- **Cache** is a smaller, faster type of memory which stores copies of the most frequently used data from main memory.

- There are different **levels** of cache: 
    - **L1** is the closest to the processor, very fast, relatively small.
    - **L2** is further from the processor, slower and larger than L1.
    - **L3** even further from the processor, slower and larger than L2.
    - etc.
