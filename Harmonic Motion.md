# Harmonic Motion

* **Harmonic motion** is a periodic motion in which the displacement is symmetrical about a point.

* The **three types** of harmonic motion are:
    1. [[Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).md | Simple (SHM)]]
    2. [[Dapmed Harmonic Motion (DHM).md | Damped (DHM)]]
    3. [[Forced Harmonic Motion (FHM).md | Forced (FHM)]]

* Each type can be **modelled** by an  [[./Second-order Differential Equations (SDEs).md|SDE]].
