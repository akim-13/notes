# Karnaugh Maps
- **Karnaugh Maps** (also called **Veitch diagrams, Karnaugh/Veitch diagrams, Carroll diagrams**) is a method to simplify Boolean algebra expressions of up to 4 variables.^[It does work with more variables, but it is not very convenient, hence it is usually not worth it.] It reduces the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of humansâ€™ pattern-recognition capability.
