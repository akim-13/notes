# Computer History
## Pre-modern Computers
- The term "**computer**" appeared in the 17th and referred to a person who computes (performs mathematical calculations.)
- **The Antikythera Device** *(100BC)* – an ancient analogue “computer” designed to calculate astronomical positions.

- **The Pascaline** *(17th century)* by *Blaise Pascal* – a calculating machine that could add and subtract numbers, as well as multiply and divide by repetition.

- **The Leibniz’ engine** (a.k.a. **Stepped Reckoner**) *(end of 17th century)* – a multi-purpose calculating device capable of multiplication and division.

- **De Colmar’s Arithmometer** *(early 19th century)* – 1st commercially successful mechanical calculator.

- **Radhanath Sikdar** *(19th century)* – an Indian mathematician, an early "computer".

## Modern Computers
- **Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine** *(19th century)* - first general-purpose, programmable, Turing-complete mechanical computer.

    - **Ada Lovelace** is the world's first programmer (she used Babbage's enginge).

### First Generation (1940s)
- Charactirized by the use of **vacuum tubes**.
- **The Colossus** *(1943)* - world's first electronic digital computer that was programmable (but dedicated to code breaking, so not general purpose).

- **ENIAC** *(1946)* - first electronic digital computer that was programmable and general purpose. 
- **MONIAC** *(1949)* - an analogue computer which used fluidic* logic to model the workings of an economy.

- However, 1st generation computers had the following **issues**:
    - Generated a lot of heat.
    - Unreliable.
    - Costly.
    - Only supported machine language.
    - Huge in size.
    - Consumed a lot of electricity.

### Second Generation (1950s): 
- Charactirized by the invention of **transistors** - small devices used to *tran*sfer electronic signals across re*sistors*.

- The **benefits of transistors** over vacuum tubes include:
    - Smaller in size.
    - Do not require warm up time.
    - Consumed less energy.
    - Generated much less heat.
    - Faster.
    - More reliable.
- An example of a 2nd generation computer is **IBM 7094**.

### Third Generation (1960s)
- Charactirized by **integrated circuits (chips)** - a set of electronic circuits on one small plate (chip) of semiconductor material, normally silicon.

- The **number of transistors** per chip was measured in *10s to 100s*.

### Fourth Generation (1970s)
- Charactirized by **Large Scale Integration (LSI)** - *10,000s* of transistors per chip.
- Steve Jobs founded **Microsoft**.
- Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded **Apple**.

### Fifth Generation (1980s)
- Charactirized by **Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)** - *billions* of transistors per chip.

### Moore's Law
- **Moore's law** states that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.
