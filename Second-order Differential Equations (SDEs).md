# Second-order Differential Equations (SDEs)

* The **general form** of a second-order [[Differential Equations.md|differential equation]] (**SDE** henceforth) is:
$$f(y'', y', y) = g(x)$$
 
* There are **two types** of SDEs:
    - [[Homogeneous SDEs|Homogeneous]], if $g(x) = 0$
    - [[Non-homogeneous SDEs|Non-homogeneous]] otherwise (same as the general form)

* SDEs can be used to **model** different types of [[./Harmonic Motion.md|harmonic motion]].
