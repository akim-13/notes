# Von Neumann Architecture (vNA)
- **The vNA** is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann.
- The **first computer to implement** the vNA was *The Manchester Baby* in 1940s.
- The vNA **components** are: 
    1. **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit) processes the data.
    2. **Control Unit** (CU) is used to:
        - Determine the operation to be performed.
        - Select the correct opeands and make them available at the right time.
        - Perform the operation on the operands by supplying the correct control data to the ALU.
        - Determine the next operation to be performed.
    3. **Memory** stores *both data and instructions* - the **main feature** of the vNA.
    4. **External mass storage**
    5. **I/O mechanisms**
- The **CPU** is a combination of the CU and ALU.
