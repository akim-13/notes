[^note]: The elements of the numeration system are that:
as many digit symbols as the base are needed;
the decimal system’s base or radix of ten, the cardinal number of standards in the basic set, is denoted by ‘10’;
place values increase from right to left in successive powers of the base (a positional system);
addition is used to make up a number consisting of combinations of digits and multiplication is used to make up the number represented by a digit in a specific place;
there is an agreed starting point (the ‘unit’ place); and
a point is used to denote this place.
