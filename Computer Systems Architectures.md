# Computer Systems Architectures

- Classically **uniprocessor^[Uniprocessor architectures are characterised  by having one ALU.] architectures** include:
    - [[Von Neumann Architecture]]
    - [[Harvard Architecture]]
- **Multiprocessor** (or **parallel**) **architectures** are potentially faster but harder to understand, control and predict.
    - There is no single dominant parallel architecture, but a set of alternatives that depend upon different **types of parallelisms** (either on *task* or *data* level) described by the [[Flynn's Taxonomy]].

- Moreover, there are different types of **[[Memory Architectures]]** â€” shared and distributed.
